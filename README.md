# Voting froject for the electoral commission CEFET/RJ - 2022
The Program was developed to verify the valid enrollments of students enrolled in CEFET/RJ. In which, if the record is true, the student's vote is counted.

# ðŸ’» About the program
The program compares two .csv files, in the first file are the student votes and in the second are the valid enrollments. The parameters to be compared are the records, the two files are compared based on the record number, and if the record is valid, its vote contained in file one is computed in the final result file. Otherwise, the program just "ignores" the invalid ones.
